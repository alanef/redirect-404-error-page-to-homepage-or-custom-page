Redirect 404 error page to homepage or any other page, with logs. Supports permanent (301), temporary (302) redirects & not found (404). Super easy to set up & use.

== Description ==

**Easily redirect WordPress 404 error pages to the homepage or any another page.** Plugin supports both permanent redirects (HTTP response status code 301) and temporary redirects (HTTP response status code 302). Plugin will start redirecting 404 error pages to the homepage as soon as you activate it by using the 301 permanent redirect. To configure it open Dashboard -> Settings -> General Settings and scroll down to the bottom.

Please note that **permalinks have to be enabled** in Dashboard -> Settings -> Permalinks in order for the 404 Redirect to work properly.

New Feature: 404 errors can be logged with this plugin so you can examine what pages may be missing.

Redirect 404 Error Page is very useful for themes that have an ugly, uninformative 404 server error page that can't be changed without messing with code and set to still return 404. Simply create a new custom 404 error page and activate the plugin - problem solved!
It's also very useful in situations when a lot of content has been removed from the site. For those situations create a new page explaining what happened and simply configure Redirect 404 to use that page.

This is an ideal plugin for missing page redirection.
